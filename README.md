### Vocabulary

*The truth will not always appear first*

## Acknowledgments

Some of the code here was taken from the internet, from various sources such as Github, StackOverflow, and others.

The idea of this application came from the best person in the entire universe. Huge thanks to Sarah, without her idea this application would have never been made.

## Final note
It all started when I was learning Korean numbers. As I figured out the logic, I created a program for the terminal to help me memorize them easily (link to the github repo: https://github.com/1anakin20/Korean). As we were in the English class watching some oral presentations, Sarah (aka The best person in the entire universe) told me the idea of making it for iOS. I started working on it, then created it with the UIKit framework (link to the github repo: https://github.com/1anakin20/korean-ios). After, Apple introduced the SwiftUI framework. I recreated the app with it. Then decided to go an extra Kilometer (or mile for the Americans) and added the Vocabulary feature. The amazing idea to recreate a simple project made me learn a lot of things. Such as git, iOS developement, and more. 

In conclusion, I just created the app, most of the work was done by Sarah. An idea created this.
